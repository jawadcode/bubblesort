# bubblesort
###### integers only btw
This is an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in the c programming language with the ability to input a custom array or generate an array of random integers (for demonstration purposes of course).
## How to run (Linux):
- (`cd bubblesort`)
- `gcc main.c -o bubblesort`
- `./bubblesort`
## How to run (Windows):
- Install wsl
- follow the linux instructions
## How to run (MacOS):
- Look up a compiler called clang
- Follow their get started guide (should be somewhat similar to gcc)
### Currently working on feature to allow the steps of the algorithm to be outputted to a text (or json) file.
